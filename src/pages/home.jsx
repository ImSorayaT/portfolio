            <p>I am web developer based in the UK. I graduated Sheffield Hallam with MSc in Web Systems Design degree in 2016. Since then I mostly worked in agencies, I cut my teeth on PHP, majority through Wordpress, but also Drupal.</p>
            <p><strong>My career goal</strong> is to continue pursuing React / more Javascript based languages, whether alongside Wordpress or stand-alone.</p>

                <li>PHP (Object oriented. While themes donâ€™t have to be Object Oriented they can be, like the ones I worked on! Drupal requires OOP)</li>

                <li>Javascript ES6</li>
